# NMRdenoiser_App
NMR denoiser effectively cleans NMR signals without introducing aliasing. The denoised output can be exported back to Bruker format, and support for other formats such as Varian is in progress. The app uses an autoencoder neural network architecture with a custom loss function designed to denoise signals effectively without overgeneralization.
